# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

I'm working on things with claude and shipping live commits, the Entire CLI should be picking things up. On their site, I'm seeing updates in the specific repos but the overview activity is not updating, why?

### Prompt 2

Let's update the CLI (keep in mind the bug we had to deal with the the hooks (global was overridding their hooks, so things weren't triggering)) -- and then check their github for issues

### Prompt 3

When I click into the individual projects it says "no session for this checkpoint" -- maybe we missed something?

### Prompt 4

Yeah
